WARNING! It is vital that the 18mm screws that come with the Big Tree Tech Eddy are used with this mount. Longer screws will bottom out (top out in this case) and cause carriage assembly issues when tightened.

Configuration files will need to be tweaked depending on the model that is printed. The configs in this repo are made for the 2mm inset model I am using.
